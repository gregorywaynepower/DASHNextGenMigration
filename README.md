## Section 1.0: Problem

We need to ensure seamless transition to DASHNextGen. We need to scrape DASH entries and place them into the Data Warehouse. We can keep the current underlying structure that we use, we just need to change the target we are scraping from.

## Section 2.0: Solution

Change where python scripts are pointing and scrape information.

## Section 3.0: Rock Deadlines

- 07/30/2020 : Have general purpose scraping script complete.
- 08/30/2020 : Have scripts ready for DASH NextGEN.

## Section 4.0: Dependencies

- Chromedriver.exe
- Python Packages:
  - pandas
